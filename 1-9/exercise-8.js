Querying Trees
Sometimes, in addition to flat arrays, we need to query trees. Trees pose a challenge because we need to flatten them into arrays in order to apply filter() and map() operations on them. In this section we'll define a concatAll() function that we can combine with map() and filter() to query trees.

Exercise 9: Flatten the movieLists array into an array of video ids

Let's start by using two nested forEach loops to collect the id of every video in the two-dimensional movieLists array.

    {
      name: "New Releases",
      videos: [
