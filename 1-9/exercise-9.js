Flattening trees with nested forEach expressions is easy because we can explicitly add items to the array. Unfortunately it's exactly this type of low-level operation that we've been trying to abstract away with functions like map() and filter(). Can we define a function that's abstract enough to express our intent to flatten a tree, without specifying too much information about how to carry out the operation?

Exercise 10: Implement concatAll()

Let's add a concatAll() function to the Array type. The concatAll() function iterates over each sub-array in the array and collects the results in a new, flat array. Notice that the concatAll() function expects each item in the array to be another array.

*/

Array.prototype.concatAll$ = function() {
  var results = [];
  this.forEach(function(subArray) {
    subArray.forEach(function(items) {
      results.push(items)
    })
  });

  return results;
};

// JSON.stringify([ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ].concatAll()) === "[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]"
// [1,2,3].concatAll(); // throws an error because this is a one-dimensional array
